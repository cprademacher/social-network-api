# Social Network API

## Description

NoSQL database and app using MongoDB

- Why did you build this project? I built this project so that users would be able to come to and from the app and the data of who their friends are and what thoughts have been posted would persist since it is saved in the MongoDB database.

- What did you learn? I learned how to integrate MongoDB into my app using Mongoose so that I am able to use JavaScript to interact with the data.

## Installation

To seed the data, type 'node utils/seed.js' in order to have starter data within the MongoDB database. Type the command 'npm start' into the console to get the server up and running. From there, use Insomnia to test out the routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data from the database.
